# ETA
A tool created for a college project. 
This tool was created to make daily responsibilities easier via Python. 
Daily tasks consist of a port scan, network connection check, and checking users and groups.

I chose these three tasks because (1) I am not too well versed in Python to do something more complex
and (2) I felt these were useful tools that check tasks that may be overlooked for leaks/vulnerabilities.
Hope you enjoy, thanks!
